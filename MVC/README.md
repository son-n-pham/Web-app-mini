# Model - View - Controller (MVC) Architecture

This is an example to practice MVC.

- The example has 2 buttons, in which one is for rendering and the other is for updating the text content of the .content div

- Files in this example project are:
  - index.html which contains html and css.
  - controller.js which is for controller the app. Controller is used to directly connect and control model and views.
  - model.js is used to manage state and interact with database.
  - Views are for interact with user through via UI (User Interface). Views are also used to render the pages/components.
